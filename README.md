# symper

This project was designed to produce a paper. Symper (short for Symmetry Perception) was an experiment run on Mechanical Turk determined to test naive perception of different kinds
of regularity, or symmetry. The experiment made use of the wallpaper patterns, which each feature some collection of different types of
regularity. In the end, we found that people can reliably distinguish between every type of regularity.
