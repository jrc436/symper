\section{Research Questions}
Due to previous work diminishing the role of symmetry groups in perception, we sought to design a conclusive experiment that tested what features of symmetry were detectable to humans. Further, we wanted to compare multiple different theories of symmetry perception in order to detect which was the most probable. In order to do this, we would design a task requiring people to differentiate wallpaper groups. Our research questions can be summarized as:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\textbf{\textit{Can people naively distinguish among the wallpaper groups?}} If the answer is yes, then we can expect that, at the very least, more features than reflection play a role in symmetry perception. Second, if people are very good at telling apart the wallpaper groups, then it's possible that symmetry, as defined by mathematics, does actually play a role in perception, fitting in nicely with a computational cognition paradigm.}
\item {\textbf{\textit{What features of symmetry drive the perception of symmetry?}} The presumption of previous studies was that it was reflection, while Clarke's study claimed it was rotation. However, this is the first study that we know of to systematically isolate various symmetries. We will additionally investigate the role of the \textit{tile shape}, the shape of the infinitely repeating component. Answering this question requires the comparison of multiple different models for how well they fit people's actual performance.}
