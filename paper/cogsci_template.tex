\begin{abstract}
Most literature on symmetry perception has focused on bilateral reflection symmetry with some suggesting that it is the only type of symmetry humans can perceive \citep{bio}. Using image stimuli generated from the mathematically well-defined seventeen wallpaper groups, this study demonstrates that humans can discriminate various symmetries found in 2D wallpaper patterns \citep{yanxitrends}. Furthermore, the results demonstrate the features which contribute to wallpaper pattern perception. All wallpaper groups but one were found to be reliably distinguishable ($p<0.05$). Wallpapers can be arranged in a hierarchy. We propose a metric to quantify subgroup similarity using the shortest path in the hierarchy. This subgroup distance was found to be a factor in a likely model of pattern perception.
