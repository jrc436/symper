\section{Figures}

All artwork must be very dark for purposes of reproduction and should
not be hand drawn. Number figures sequentially, placing the figure
number and caption, in 10~point, after the figure with one line space
above the caption and one line space below it, as in
Figure~\ref{sample-figure}. If necessary, leave extra white space at
the bottom of the page to avoid splitting the figure and figure
caption. You may float figures to the top or bottom of a column, or
set wide figures across both columns.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\fbox{CoGNiTiVe ScIeNcE}
\end{center}
\caption{This is a figure.} 
\label{sample-figure}
