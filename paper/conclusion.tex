\section{Conclusion}
This paper argues that human pattern perception is sensitive to more types of symmetry than previously thought. To date, data on types of symmetry other than bilateral reflection were limited; however, we present evidence that humans can and do perceive the other types of symmetry. We found that all but one pair of wallpaper groups are reliably distinguishable ($p < 0.05$) and all are likely distinguishable ($p < 0.1$). After comparing models, we found that certain axes in reflection and certain types of rotation both play a role in symmetry detection. Notably, we also found that subgroup distance is a viable predictor of the accuracy of similarity judgments.
