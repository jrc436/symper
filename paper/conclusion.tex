\section{Conclusion}
This paper gives an overview and preliminary results to expand work on perception of symmetry. Presently, very few researchers have done any experiments on types of symmetry other than bilateral reflection; however, we present evidence that humans can and do perceive the other types of symmetry. We found that all but one pair of wallpaper groups are distinguishable (p < 0.5) and all are likely distinguishable (p < 0.1). After comparing models, we found that certain axes in reflection and certain types of rotation both play a role in symmetry detection. Notably, we also found a highly significant effect in the subgroup distance.
