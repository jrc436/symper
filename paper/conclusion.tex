\section{Conclusion}
This paper gives an overview and preliminary results to expand work on perception of symmetry. Presently, very few researchers have done any experiments on types of symmetry other than bilateral reflection; however, we present evidence that humans can and do perceive the other types of symmetry. Notably, we find a significant effect due to the tile shape, glide reflection, and the relation distance, but not rotation and reflection, which have received much more attention. We present this as evidence that perception of symmetry is highly related with mathematical symmetry.
