The concept of \emph{symmetry} refers to a common property of everyday objects and images. Symmetry, at its simplest, can be thought of as a redundant feature of an object. Symmetry has received much attention as a feature of visual perception and attention (see \citep{review} for a review). However, symmetry as a geometric concept is much more general: symmetry refers to any transformation of an object or image that leaves it with the exact same appearance. Exactly four types of symmetry are distinguished in two dimensional images.
