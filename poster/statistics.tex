We used simple binomial t-tests to determine how accurate humans were at distinguishing among every wallpaper group. We also used a Linear Mixed Effects Model to determine what drives the variance in distinguishing between two pairs of wallpapers. Our features in the model consisted of the symmetries as defined by the group-theoretic analysis of the wallpaper groups. We additionally considered \textit{subgroup distance}, an aggregate measure referring to the shortest path in the subgroup graph, and \textit{tile shape}, the piece of the image that is infinitely translated.
