The best model was identified according to Aikake Information Criterion (AIC), among the models including the pool of features described earlier. This best model included distance, but additionally included the $T_1$ axis, which would correspond to bilateral reflection symmetry, the $D_1$ axis, which is the positive diagonal, 4-fold rotation, and 3-fold rotation.
