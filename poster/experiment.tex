We recruited 106 subjects from the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform to compare among the wallpaper groups. Their basic task was to match two wallpapers from the same group. The third image could be from any of the other sixteen groups. In this way, we could distinguish how difficult it is for humans to tell the groups apart. Further, we only allowed each participant five seconds, in order to force them to rely on perceptual, rather than analytical, processes. All subjects were compensated for their time, though 12 were excluded for behavior consistent with not taking the task seriously.
