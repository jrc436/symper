We use \emph{wallpapers} to create images that use combinations of these symmetry types. Wallpapers are two-dimensional images made from an infinitely repeating symmetric \textit{tile}. These tiles are characterized by a specific set of symmetries. There are exactly seventeen wallpaper groups, as has been well-known for over a hundred years \citep{wallpaper-proof}. In other words, every two-dimensional repeating image has one of seventeen sets of symmetries. These wallpapers can be arranged in a hierarchy, which we argue relates to how they are perceived.
