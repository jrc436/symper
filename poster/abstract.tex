This paper investigates human ability to innately perceive multiple different features of symmetry. While most work has focused on simple bilateral reflection symmetry, these experiments make a case that humans can perceive much more than that. By using a set of images that each conform to one of the seventeen wallpaper groups, we investigate which wallpapers groups are easiest and most difficult to tell apart. This allows us to provide evidence that rotation and reflection are not sufficient in explaining perception of symmetry, challenging some prevailing notions.
