The best model (by AIC ) included subgroup distance, the $T_1$ axis (lateral reflection symmetry), the $D_1$ axis (the positive diagonal), 4-fold and 3-fold rotation. Our participants were quite good at distinguishing among the groups, though accuracy varied. \textit{Subgroup distance} was a significant and improved the AIC of every model. This could mean that human pattern analysis at the rapid heuristic level is similar to the mathematical level.
