We used Aikake Information Criterion (AIC) to identify the best model. This model included subgroup distance, the $T_1$ axis (which would correspond to bilateral reflection symmetry), the $D_1$ axis (the positive diagonal), 4-fold rotation, and 3-fold rotation. While the groups varied largely in their ability to be distinguished, humans were quite good at distinguishing them in general. \textit{Subgroup distance} was a significant feature in every considered model; it additionally improved the AIC of every model. Therefore, it is likely it plays some role in human perception of symmetry. This could mean that human pattern analysis at the rapid heuristic level is similar to the mathematical level.
